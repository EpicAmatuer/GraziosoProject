Final assignment for SNHU IT-145

This was my submission for the final project of IT-145 at SNHU. It garnered a solid 'A' and 
received tremendous accolades from the instructor. I am posting it here to aid other students who may be meeting with difficulty
in the same course. This is not intended as an offer to help anyone cheat or plagiarize. I did the work, you can too.
